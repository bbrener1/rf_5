# Figures

This directory contains notebooks used to create the figures appearing in the forthcoming publication of this method.

These figure notebooks are also useful as a guided tour of the features contained in the package that are not covered in the basic tutorial. 

In order to run these notebooks yourself you will need to obtain the Ximerakis dataset, which is described in 

`Ximerakis, Methodios, Scott L. Lipnick, Brendan T. Innes, Sean K. Simmons, Xian Adiconis, Danielle Dionne, Brittany A. Mayweather et al. "Single-cell transcriptomic profiling of the aging mouse brain." Nature neuroscience 22, no. 10 (2019): 1696-1708.`
